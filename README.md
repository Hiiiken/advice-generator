# advice-generator

## Overview
This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).

### Challenge Features

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Additional Features

- I added pagination functionality to the app to allow the user to move between Next/Previous advices
- The buttons are disabled by default until more advices are generated
- When reaching the last or first adive, the next or previous button becomes disabled to indicate that

### What I learned
This was a fun project where I got to practice VueJS more and learn how to get data from an API and display it the way I want in the page.

I also explored how to create Next and Previous buttons to move between the array elements, and also make them disabled 
when reaching the first item or last item.
